TI  - Perspectives for computer modeling in the study of T cell activation.
PG  - a005538
AB  - The T cell receptor (TCR) is responsible for discriminating between self-
      and foreign-derived peptides, translating minute differences in amino-acid
      sequence into large differences in response. Because of the great
      variability in the TCR and its ligands, activation of T cells by foreign
      peptides is a quantitative process, dependent on a mix of upstream signals
      and downstream integration. Accordingly, quantitative data and
      computational models have shed light on many important aspects of this
      process: molecular noise in ligand recognition, spatial dynamics in T
      cell-APC (antigen presenting cell) interactions, graded versus all-or-none
      decision making by the TCR apparatus, mechanisms of peptide antagonism and
      synergism, and the tunability and robustness of activation thresholds.
      Though diverse in their formalism, these studies together paint a picture
      of how modeling has shaped and will continue to shape understanding of T
      cell immunobiology.

TI  - Optimal germinal center responses require a multistage T cell:B cell
      adhesion process involving integrins, SLAM-associated protein, and CD84.
PG  - 253-65
AB  - CD4(+) T cells deficient in signaling lymphocyte activation molecule
      (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP) exhibit a selective impairment in adhesion
      to antigen-presenting B cells but not dendritic cells (DCs), resulting in
      defective germinal center formation. However, the nature of this selective
      adhesion defect remained unclear. We found that whereas T cell:DC
      interactions were primarily integrin dependent, T cell:B cell interactions
      had both an early integrin-dependent phase and a sustained phase that also
      required SAP. We further found that the SLAM family member CD84 was
      required for prolonged T cell:B cell contact, optimal T follicular helper
      function, and germinal center formation in vivo. Moreover, both CD84 and
      another SLAM member, Ly108, mediated T cell adhesion and participated in
      stable T cell:B cell interactions in vitro. Our results reveal insight
      into the dynamic regulation of T cell:B cell interactions and identify
      SLAM family members as critical components of sustained T cell:B cell
      adhesion required for productive humoral immunity.

TI  - Visualization and identification of IL-7 producing cells in reporter mice.
PG  - e7637
AB  - Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is required for lymphocyte development and
      homeostasis although the actual sites of IL-7 production have never been
      clearly identified. We produced a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
      transgenic mouse expressing ECFP in the Il7 locus. The construct lacked a
      signal peptide and ECFP (enhanced cyan fluorescent protein) accumulated
      inside IL-7-producing stromal cells in thoracic thymus, cervical thymus
      and bone marrow. In thymus, an extensive reticular network of
      IL-7-containing processes extended from cortical and medullary epithelial
      cells, closely contacting thymocytes. Central memory CD8 T cells, which
      require IL-7 and home to bone marrow, physically associated with
      IL-7-producing cells as we demonstrate by intravital imaging.

TI  - B-cell follicle development remodels the conduit system and allows soluble
      antigen delivery to follicular dendritic cells.
PG  - 4989-97
AB  - Afferent lymph is transported throughout lymph nodes (LNs) by the conduit
      system. Whereas this conduit network is dense in the T-cell zone, it is
      sparse in B-cell follicles. In this study, we show that this differential
      organization emerges during lymph node development. Neonatal LNs lack B
      follicles, but have a developed T-cell zone and a dense conduit network.
      As new T and B cells enter the developing LN, the conduit network density
      is maintained in the T, but not the B zone, leading to a profound
      remodeling of the follicular network that nevertheless maintains its
      connectivity. In adults, the residual follicular conduits transport
      soluble antigen to deep regions, where follicular dendritic cells are
      abundant and appear to replace the fibroblastic reticular cells that
      enwrap conduits in the T zone. This strategic location correlates with the
      capacity of the follicular dendritic cells to capture antigen even in the
      absence of antigen-specific antibodies. Together, these results describe
      how the stromal organization of the T and B regions of LNs diverges during
      development, giving rise to distinct antigen transport and delivery modes
      in the 2 compartments.
