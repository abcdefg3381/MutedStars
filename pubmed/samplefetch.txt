TI  - Quantification of myocardial iron overload by cardiovascular magnetic
      resonance imaging T2* and review of the literature.
PG  - E55-9
AB  - Heart failure due to myocardial iron overload remains the leading cause of
      death in patients with transfusion-dependent anemias. Iron
      overload-induced cardiomyopathy is reversible if intensive chelation
      therapy is instituted on time. Thus, early detection of myocardial iron
      deposition is imperative to prevent overt heart failure. Conventional
      cardiac monitoring, including physical examination, electrocardiography,
      echocardiography or serum ferritin levels fail to predict manifest or
      subclinical myocardial involvement resulting from iron overload.
      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging T2* (cMRI-T2*, pronounced T2
      star) times correlate well with myocardial iron levels. This timely review
      focuses on the utility of cMRI-T2*, for the preclinical detection of
      myocardial iron overload and monitoring of myocardial iron content during
      chelation therapy.

TI  - Implantable cardioverter defibrillators save lives from lightning-related
      electrocution too!
PG  - 256-7
AB  - We report an unusual case of a 75-year-old male electrocuted by lightning
      strike rescued by implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shock
      coincidentally. Lightning strikes are an unusual cause of fatal cardiac
      arrhythmias. Depending on the amount of energy and the current vector
      affecting the heart, the arrhythmia burden ranges from asystole to
      ventricular fibrillation.

TI  - Improving death certificate completion: a trial of two training
      interventions.
PG  - 544-8
AB  - The death certificate is an important medical document that impacts
      mortality statistics and health care policy. Resident physician accuracy
      in completing death certificates is poor. We assessed the impact of two
      educational interventions on the quality of death certificate completion
      by resident physicians. Two-hundred and nineteen internal medicine
      residents were asked to complete a cause of death statement using a sample
      case of in-hospital death. Participants were randomized into one of two
      educational interventions: either an interactive workshop (group I) or
      provided with printed instruction material (group II). A total of 200
      residents completed the study, with 100 in each group. At baseline,
      competency in death certificate completion was poor. Only 19% of residents
      achieved an optimal test score. Sixty percent erroneously identified a
      cardiac cause of death. The death certificate score improved significantly
      in both group I (14+/-6 vs 24+/-5, p<0.001) and group II (14+/-5 vs
      19+/-5, p<0.001) postintervention from baseline. Group I had a higher
      degree of improvement than group II (24+/-5 vs 19+/-5, p<0.001). Resident
      physicians' skills in death certificate completion can be improved with an
      educational intervention. An interactive workshop is a more effective
      intervention than a printed handout.

TI  - Cardiac troponin I release in non-ischemic reversible myocardial injury
      from acute diphtheric myocarditis.
PG  - 351-4
AB  - Cardiac troponins are highly specific markers of myocardial injury. It has
      been suggested that, unlike other markers of myocardial injury, troponins
      could be released in reversible myocardial injury and the myocardial
      necrosis does not have to occur for troponins to be released from
      myocytes. Reversibly injury related changes in myocyte membrane are
      considered sufficient for the release of cardiac troponins from the free
      cytosolic pool, whereas in case of irreversible myocardial injury the
      source of troponin release is the structural damage of the myocytes.
      Diphtheria is a localized infection of skin and mucous membranes with
      multi-system involvement caused by gram-positive aerobic rod
      Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The cardiac involvement in diphtheria is
      characterized by severe impairment of cardiac contractility. The
      myocardial injury induced by diphtheric toxins could be completely
      reversible with successful treatment. We report a case of diphtheric
      myocarditis in a 20-year-old female who presented with complaints of
      dysphagia, dysphonia, fatigue, generalized malaise and severe dyspnea. She
      developed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction
      10%) with markedly elevated serum levels of cardiac troponin I (peak 48.5
      ng/ml). Within a few days on treatment, the cardiac function became
      completely normal (left ventricular ejection fraction 60%) and the
      elevation in serum level of cardiac troponin I resolved. This case
      supports the notion that cardiac troponin I could be released in
      reversible myocardial injury and that in such case the recovery of
      myocardial function is independent of serum levels of cardiac troponin I
      measured during the acute phase of illness.
